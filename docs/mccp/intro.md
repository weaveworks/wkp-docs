## What is Multi-cluster Control Plane?

The multi-cluster control plane (MCCP) provides ops teams with an easy way to assess the
health of multiple clusters in a single place. It shows cluster information such as
Kubernetes version and number of nodes and provides details about the GitOps operations
on those clusters, such as Git repositories and recent commits. Additionally, it
aggregates Prometheus alerts to assist with troubleshooting.
