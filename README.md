# DEPRECATED: Website for docs.wkp.weave.works

See https://github.com/weaveworks/corp/issues/3091

---

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```console
yarn install
```

## Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Deployment happens automatically (once the tests pass) upon merging to the default branch: see [.github/workflows/documentation.yml](.github/workflows/documentation.yml) for config.
